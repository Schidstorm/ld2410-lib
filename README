# LD2410 library

A library to communicate with the LD2410 module.
Also supports engineering mode report packages.

Tested with a ESP-12-F module with the Arduino Framework.

For examples please take a look in the "examples" folder.

Note:

If you set the build_type to debug, the build might fail (on my ESK-12F). I think it is because the binary is too large. No problems when you set it to test or release.
